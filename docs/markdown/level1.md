### Operator SDK
- controller-runtime library
- integreation with Operator Lifecycle Manager(OLM)
- metrics with prometheus operator

<aside class="notes">
	- Operator SDK is a framework that uses controller-runtime library which (simplifies building,
	testing, packaging ops)
	<br>
	- we used op sdk to orchestrate our op came with lots out of the box like
	<br>
	- Tools for scaffolding and code generation to quickly bootstrap a new project
	<br>
	- Integration with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to streamline packaging, installing, and running Operators on a cluster
	<br>
	- Metrics set up automatically in any generated Go-based Operator for use on clusters where the Prometheus Operator is deployed

### Custom Resource
```
apiVersion: pets.bestie.com/v1
kind: Bestie
metadata:
  name: bestie
spec:
  size: 3
  image: quay.io/opdev/bestie
  maxReplicas: 10
  version: "1.3"
```

<aside class="notes">
	- an object that allows you to extend Kubernetes capabilities by adding any kind of API object useful for your application
	- CR we create signals to the controller to create the deploy, service job, needed to help make application run
	- This is the sticky note that the controller watches and tries to copy whenever an event occurs

### Controller & Reconciler

<aside class="notes">
	- Control loop that watches the state of the current cluster and tries to bring it
	closer to the desired state that's declared in the resource definition files.
	<br>
	- An controller can be though of as a person who is doing things by looking up sticky note/template/image/recipe that we provide(cr)
	<br>
	- EX: something happens(event) we install the operator (event) controller runtimes triggered controller which looks up the sticky note (cr) and does a something (reconcile),
	it calls reconciler function to check the status of our resource (deploy, job, postgrescluster) and if its not what we want it brings it closer to what we define in our resource definition file
	<br>
	- Summary: Now the l5 operator has level 1 capabilites it has the controller and the CR, so it can automatically provision and configure all the resource we need for the flask application upon installation
	<br>
	- Next Soundharya will talk more about the capabilities of a level 2 operator and how
	we brought the l5 operator from level 1: basic installation to level 2: seamless upgrades
