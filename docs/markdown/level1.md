### Controller & Reconciler




<aside class="notes">
	- Control loop that watches the state of the current cluster and tries to bring it
	closer to the desired state that's declared in the resource definition files.
	- An controller is basically a human who is running commands based on a sticky note (cr)
	for example: something happens (event) the controller looks up the sticky note (cr) and does a thing (reconcile)
	- Next Soundharya will talk more about the capabilities of a level 2 operator and how
	we brought the l5 operator from level 1: basic installation to level 2: seamless upgrades
