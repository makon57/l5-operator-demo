					<h2>From Zero to <span style="color:red">Auto Pilot</span>:</h2>
					<p>Exploring Kubernetes Operator Capability Levels</p>

					<h3>What is the L5 operator <a href="https://bestie-rescue.herokuapp.com/">?</a></h3>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">What is an <span style="color:red">Auto Pilot</span> operator?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						- The L5 operator is an operator with autopilot capabilities that manages and consumes a flask app with a postgres database utilizing
						the Crunchy Postgres Operator.
						<br>
						- Following the Operator Framework, the L5 operator was created to demonstrate the capabilities of an operator
						from Level 1:basic installation to Level 5:autopilot.
						<br>
						- With an autopilot operator being our end goal for our operator
						- What is an autopilot operator... *transition to the next slide*
						<br>
						- The Operator Framework defines that very will in their capabilities model

					<h2>Operator Framework</h2>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5I5Eet4.jpg" alt="capability levels">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							- Operator Framework is an open source toolkit used to manage Operators,
							in an effective, automated, and scalable way.
						<br>
							- Operators come in different maturity levels so this
							capability model aims to provide a guide as to what features users can
							expect from an Operator.
						<br>
							- The operator framework defines 5 levels of operator capabilities. level 1: basic install, level 2: seamless
							upgrade, level 3: backup & restore, level 4: deep insights, and level 5: autopilot.
						<br>
							- Our goal with the l5-operator is to showcase all the capabilities of an operator all the way until it reaches complete autopilot
							- An autopilot operator can auto-scale, auto-heal, auto-tune, & detect abnormailities(deviations from standard performance and act on it automatically or alert us)
						<br>
							- Currently on operatorhub.io
							70% of the published operators have level 2 capabilities and only 5% of operators have level 5 capabilities.
						<br>
							- In this presentation we hope to enable our participants to create operators with greater capabilities as well as add more
							capabilities to existing operators hoping to bring their operators to autopilot as well.
